. <dd>These are timer-based hazards that count down with each game turn. When a
. turn counter reaches zero, the associated event handler is called via a jump
. table.</dd>

. <dd>Mostly atmospheric events that randomly appear in different locations to
. add flavor to the game world (like seagulls appearing at the beach).</dd>
. <dd>The routine maintains a table of current locations for each scenic event.

. randomly relocates it to one of its valid rooms.</dd>
. <dd>Each scenic event has a predefined group of rooms where the event can
. appear.</dd></dl>)
. The routine ensures that:
. #LIST
. { Multiple turn-based dangers can threaten the player simultaneously }
. { Scenic events don't repeatedly trigger in the same room }
. { The game world feels dynamic with events occurring in different locations }
. LIST#
N $C17D First process the turn-based events (if any are active).
